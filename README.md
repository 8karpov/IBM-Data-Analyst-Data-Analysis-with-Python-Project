# Data Analysis with Python Project
This project was completed during completing the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program

# Final Project Scenario

In this assignment, I was a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I was tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. A template notebook is provided in the lab; My job was to complete the ten questions. Some hints to the questions were given in the template notebook.
